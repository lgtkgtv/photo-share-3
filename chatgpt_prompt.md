## prompt 1

I will like to design a Photo Sharing web Application using Python FastAPI   
I will like to use Dockerized microservices

For development I am using Ubuntu 24.04 desktop. 

I shall be able to develop and test the app on my local desktop but I want this to be a professional, secure and  scalable solution to deploy on kubernetes cluster in a clould environment. 

For early development on my local desktop, I don't want to use kubernetes but use docker container based microservices.

Below are some of my design requirements.

| Area                     | Decision                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database**             | PostgreSQL                                                                |
| **Persistence Layer**    | DAO (Data Access Object) abstraction                                      |
| **ORM**                  | SQLAlchemy ORM                                                            |
| **Photo Metadata**       | filename, upload time, tags, description, owner ID, visibility            |
| **Photo Visibility**     | `private`, `shared`, `public`                                             |
| **User Profiles**        | Support bio, profile picture; public or private visibility                |
| **Photo Grouping**       | Albums (planned for future)                                               |
| **Search/Filter**        | By tags or descriptions                                                   |
| **Auth Methods**         | Email/password + optional OAuth (Google/Facebook)                         |
| **Email Verification**   | Time-bound secret-based registration confirmation                         |
| **Security & Testing**   | Secure modular design, `pytest` support for all DAOs                      |
| **Development Strategy** | Keep it CLI (`curl`-based) for now; user interface deferred intentionally |

We need not develop all these features in one single step. I will like you to propose a step by step plan to implement this application.

## 🔐 Security Tips From the Start

* Store secrets in `.env`, never hardcode
* Use hashed passwords (`bcrypt`)
* Validate all input with Pydantic models
* Use JWT with short expiry + refresh tokens
* Sanitize file uploads (filename, size, type)
* Use `pytest` + `coverage` for test coverage early
* Plan CORS, rate limiting, and email rate throttling

Would you like me to:

1. Scaffold the Phase 1 project structure + `docker-compose.yml`?
2. Implement user registration (DAO, email verification)?
3. Help with Docker and PostgreSQL setup?

Let me know where you'd like to start.

## prompt 2

Yes to 1,2,3. Also, don't use the canvas. Stay with this chat interface. You will generate all the code and provide me a downloadble zip file with instructions to setup my local Ubuntu Desktop environment and instructions to build and test the generated code. Please make sure all the code is well documented.  Include a README.md, .env, .gitignore files. Also include some sample image files and sample testdata for easier testing and verification of user registrations, user logins, and photo share application features. In case I need to create a python virtual environment, please provide instructions for that.

✅ DB initialization script

backend/init_db.py
```sh
import asyncio
from services.db import engine, Base
from models import user, email_verification  # ensure models are imported

async def init_models():
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(init_models())
```

# ✅ How To Build and Test Locally 
 
### 1. Set up Python venv

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

### 2. Start services

docker-compose down
docker ps -a
docker-compose up --build


### 3. Run the `DB initialization script` manually to initialize DB:
**open another terminal and run following:**

docker-compose exec backend python init_db.py

    Expected output: 
        Tables `users` and `email_verifications` will be created inside the `photoapp PostgreSQL` database.


### 4. Register user:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "user1@example.com", "password": "testpass123"}'

    Expected output:
    {
      "id": 1,
      "email": "user1@example.com",
      "is_active": true,
      "is_verified": false
    }
```


### 4. Request verification

```

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/request-verification \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "user1@example.com"}'

    Expected Response:
        {"message":"Verification email sent (simulated)"}
        
     🖨️ Check your terminal logs — you'll see:
     [DEBUG] Verification link: http://localhost:8000/api/users/verify-email?secret=...

```

### 5. Copy the URL and paste in browser or use curl:

```

curl "http://localhost:8000/api/users/verify-email?secret=<abc123>"
    
    Expected Response:
    {"message":"Email user1@example.com successfully verified."}

```

# Testing `JWT login` and `Secure /me endpoint`

✅ JWT login
✅ Secure /me endpoint
✅ Token refresh support

### Log in to get a token

TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/login \
  -F "username=user1@example.com" \
  -F "password=testpass123" | jq -r .access_token)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    http://localhost:8000/api/users/me
 
---    
# prompt: add token expiration inspection or a token revocation mechanism
---
FastAPI with OAuth2PasswordBearer and python-jose will automatically raise `401 Unauthorized` if:
    Token is expired
    Token is invalid

✅ Token Management with Redis (Both TTL + Manual Blacklist)

🧱 Implementation Plan
    Add Redis to docker-compose.yml
    Add Redis client to backend (redis.asyncio)
    Generate JWT with jti (unique ID)
    Store jti in Redis on logout
    Check Redis on every authenticated request
    ✅ Token expires automatically via standard JWT exp
    ✅ Manual revocation via Redis blacklist

Redis connection details stored in .env? Yes
Set JWT expiration to be 5 minutes (default) or it can be customized in the .env
Use Logout endpoint: /logout (default) -- No need to customize this. 

✅ Redis Licensing and Cost
| Item                | Status                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔓 **Open Source**  | Yes, Redis is licensed under the **BSD 3-Clause License**.           |
| 💰 **Free of Cost** | Yes, Redis itself is **100% free and open-source**.                  |
| 📦 Docker image     | The official Redis image on Docker Hub is also free and widely used. |

✅ Confirmed and Locked Security Design Choices
| Feature                        | Decision                                           | Notes                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔐 JWT Expiration              | `5 minutes` by default                             | Can be customized via `.env` (`JWT_EXP_MINUTES`) |
| 🔁 Token Revocation via Redis  | **Enabled** (manual logout + auto-expire in Redis) | `jti` used as Redis key                          |
| 🌐 Redis Connection Config     | Stored in `.env`                                   | Uses `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, etc.            |
| 🧑‍🚪 Logout Endpoint           | `/logout`                                          | Standard RESTful design                          |
| 🔒 Blacklist Token on Logout   | **Yes**                                            | Prevents reuse of revoked tokens                 |
| 🚫 Check Redis for Revoked JWT | **Yes** on all protected endpoints                 | Enhances security for session control            |


## 
🔐 JWT with exp (default 5 min) + jti for revocation
🚪 /logout endpoint with Redis-stored revoked token IDs
🔄 .env now supports custom JWT expiry and Redis config
🧠 token_utils.py handles JWT creation and validation
✅ All code passes lint checks

🧪 Example CURL Tests in README.md

    You’ll find working examples for:

        Registering users
        Requesting/Verifying emails
        Logging in and using the token
        Logging out and verifying token invalidation 

✅ Redis Cleanup Strategy
✅ Recommendation: Use EX (TTL) on jti entries when calling redis.set(), matching the JWT
| Feature                 | Why                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EX=jwt_expiry_seconds` | Ensures automatic cleanup without a cron job or manual purge |
| Stateless cleanup       | Scales effortlessly across containers/pods                   |
| Matches token lifecycle | No stale entries or memory leaks                             |
🔒 Locked decision: We’ll store each jti in Redis with a TTL matching the token’s exp.

✅ Redis in Production (Robust Mode)
✅ Recommendation: 
Stick with single-node Redis for now, but use Dockerized Redis with persistence (appendonly yes) in redis.conf. 
Then upgrade to managed Redis (AWS ElastiCache or GCP Memorystore) when moving to cloud.

Phase	Setup
Local Dev	Docker Redis with AOF persistence
Prod in Cloud	AWS ElastiCache / GCP Memorystore (cluster mode disabled initially)

🔒 Locked decision: Start with `Docker Redis + AOF`. Move to managed Redis on cloud deployment.

✅ Frontend Integration
✅ Recommendation: Expose a clean OpenAPI spec via FastAPI's auto-generated docs (/docs) and 
                   delay frontend integration until core functionality is stable.
| Approach           | Why                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| No frontend yet    | Avoid doubling surface area during backend hardening |
| OpenAPI at `/docs` | Allows frontend teams to mock/test with Swagger UI   |
| Add CORS config    | Future-proof for any JS frontend (React, Vue, etc.)  |
🔒 Locked decision: Enable CORS now with a safe default. Defer frontend until backend is hardened.

✅ Future Kubernetes Deployment Considerations
| Feature        | Recommendation                           | Why                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Redis          | External Redis (AWS/GCP managed)         | Simplifies HA, backups, and failover     |
| Env config     | `.env` → Kubernetes Secrets or ConfigMap | Secure, declarative configuration        |
| JWT revocation | Shared Redis instance                    | Ensures token blacklist sync across pods |
| Auth flow      | Short-lived JWT + Redis blacklist        | Secure and stateless                     |

## production-ready photo-sharing app backend with Redis-based JWT revocation
✅ JWT with 5-minute expiration (ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)

✅ Redis-based \logout with `jti` token revocation
✅ Centralized `token_utils.py` with linter-compliant code
✅ .env for:
    JWT_SECRET_KEY
    REDIS_URL
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES (default: 5)
✅ Updated `README.md` with setup and test instructions
✅ Verified with no linter warnings

💡 Production Design Notes:
    Redis TTL is used for auto-cleanup of revoked tokens (no cron needed)
    Designed for future deployment to Kubernetes on AWS/GCP
    Minimal but extensible code structure

## validate the new functionality using the updated `README.md`, which includes:
    ✅ User registration + email verification
    ✅ Login to get a JWT with 5-minute expiry
    ✅ Token-based /me access
    ✅ /logout endpoint to revoke token via Redis
    ✅ Redis-based enforcement: revoked or expired tokens are rejected

## Next Steps 
    Dockerfile/compose hardening for cloud deployment?
    Healthcheck or readiness/liveness probes for k8s?
    Metrics/observability hooks?
